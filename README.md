# Telco classification project

# Project Description:
Telco is a company that provides communication and media services to customers that include phone services, multiple phone lines, online security, online_backup, device protection, tech support services, streaming tv services, and streaming movies services. Within codeup database we have collected telco customer account information and customers demographics. I would like to look into drivers of customer churn and what actions can be put in place to prevent customer churn.

# Project Goal:
* Discover drivers of customer churn
* Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to predict weather or not a telco customer will churn.

# Initial Thoughts:
My initial hypothesis is that high monthly charges cause for a telco customer to churn.

# The Plan
* Aquire data from codeup database

* Prepare data

  * Create Engineered columns from existing data
    *
    *

* Explore data in search of drivers of upsets

  * Answer the following initial questions
    * How often does churn occur?
    * Does having a high monthly charge affect churn?
    * Is beign a senior citizen affact churn?
    * Does tenure affect churn?
    * Does the contract type of customer affect churn?
   
  
    
* Develop a Model to predict if a chess game will end in an upset

    * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
    * Evaluate models on train and validate data
    * Select the best model based on highest accuracy
    * Evaluate the best model on test data
    
* Draw conclusions
